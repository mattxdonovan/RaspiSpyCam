Raspberry Pi Push button Spy Cam

 For this project I connected a breadboard with a button and a portable battery to a Raspberry Pi with the V2.1 module. 
 The launcher script excecutes the video script so this can be used without a screen and on the go. 
 Once the button is pushed a 5 minute video will be taken.
